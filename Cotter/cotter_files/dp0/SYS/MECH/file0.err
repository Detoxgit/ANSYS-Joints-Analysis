 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.719   TIME= 11:14:31
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.406   TIME= 11:14:31
 Material number 10 (used by element 83582) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.469   TIME= 11:14:31
 It has been detected that you are using reduced integration brick       
 elements along with the PCG solver (EQSLV,PCG).  Please verify that     
 you have multiple elements through the thickness in your model or       
 switch to the SPARSE solver (EQSLV,SPARSE).                             

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      90.625   TIME= 11:15:55
 Contact element 70252 (real ID 4) has too much sliding distance         
 1.17916306 relative to target element 77243.  Switch to finite or       
 instant small sliding logic (KEYOPT(18)=0,2) to better represent this   
 situation if desired.                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      90.625   TIME= 11:15:55
 Contact element 82959 (real ID 9) has too much sliding distance         
 0.784516651 relative to target element 81911.  Switch to finite or      
 instant small sliding logic (KEYOPT(18)=0,2) to better represent this   
 situation if desired.                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      90.938   TIME= 11:15:55
 Contact element 81193 (real ID 7) has too much sliding distance         
 0.69589652 relative to target element 79915.  Switch to finite or       
 instant small sliding logic (KEYOPT(18)=0,2) to better represent this   
 situation if desired.
