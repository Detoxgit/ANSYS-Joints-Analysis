# Cotter and Knuckle Joint FEA Simulation (ANSYS)

## Project Summary

Performed finite element analysis (FEA) of two key mechanical joints using **ANSYS Workbench**:

- **Cotter Joint**
- **Knuckle Joint**

Simulated real-world loading conditions to study **stress distribution**, **deformation**, and **failure-prone zones**.

## Work Done

- Imported 3D CAD models (Fusion 360 / STEP files)
- Applied boundary conditions:
  - Fixed supports at constrained faces
  - Applied axial loads mimicking real operation
- Defined **frictional and bonded contacts** for interfaces
- Generated a high-quality mesh
- Solved using **Static Structural Analysis**
- Evaluated:
  - Equivalent (Von Mises) Stress
  - Total Deformation
  - Normal and Shear Stress
